    <p class="greet">Dear Dr.Kim Myunghee,</p>
    
    <p class="indented">I'm writing to express my interest in the Graduate Research Assistant position posted by the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. I am an incoming graduate student majoring in Civic Analytics starting Fall of 2024, and I aim to blend my engineering skills with data analytics to further my career. I've been actively seeking assistantship opportunities to support my academic pursuits, and I believe this position perfectly complements my undergraduate background while allowing me to remain involved in the engineering field.</p><p class="indented">

        The job posting's preferred qualification regarding experience with Arduino caught my attention. During my time at Louisiana Tech as an undergraduate student, I gained extensive hands-on experience with Arduino. Additionally, I have practical experience in constructing data collection systems using Arduino and conducting data visualization using Python. Although I've primarily worked in the public sector since graduation, I'm confident that with some guidance, I can quickly refresh my skills and make valuable contributions as a research assistant.
        
        </p><p class="indented">The responsibilities outlined for this position, including mentoring, supervising, and assisting graduate and undergraduate students, resonate with my past experiences. At Louisiana Tech, I served as a tutor, engineering lab attendant, and teaching assistant, honing my ability to support and guide students effectively.</p>
        
        I am excited about the opportunity and would be happy to provide you with any needed information.</p>


        <p>Sincerely, </p>

          <h3> 
            Zero Emission Gas Well</h3><p> Spring 2021-Fall 2021</p>
          <p>The project was sponsored by Nadal & Gussman, a natural gas company located in Ruston, LA. The company desired a solution to reduce natural gas emissions at well sites. During operation of the pneumatic devices, natural gas is emitted to the environment. The major constituent of natural gas is methane, which is a greenhouse gas hazardous than carbon dioxide. The engineering team successfully fabricated a solution which included a storage thank that supplied compressed air to operate the devices, instead of the natural gas previously used. This design completely eliminates the emissions from pneumatic device operation. A remote area power supply (RAPS) system was implemented into the design, as the locations of the gas well-sites do not have access to the power grid.</p>
