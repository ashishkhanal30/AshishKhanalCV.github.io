        <div class="sub-section">
      <h3>Semantic Search</h3>
      <p>This is a full-stack semantic search application that allows users to upload a pdf and perform intelligent, context-aware searches on the content of the pdf. Users can receive the response to their prompt and also be able to see where in the pdf the prompt related content is mentioned, as it will highlight the areas related to the prompt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-section">
      <h3>Spoken Digit Prediction</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model capable of predicting digits spoken in audio files. The project utilizes the free-spoken-digit-dataset from Jakobovski's GitHub repository, specifically designed for ease of use as the audio equivalent of the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The audio files in the dataset were short sound clips, each under one second in duration. Two model architectures were experimented with: a Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Both models use spectrogram images of audio files as input.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-section">
      <h3>BarCode and Grid Art Generator</h3>
      <p>Developed a Python implementation that converts high-resolution images into simplified barcode and grid art representations. The goal was to downsample digital images to create visually appealing and easy-to-recreate designs, using only black and white elements. The tool processes images by reducing their resolution, simplifying pixel data, and then translating this into barcode-like or grid-based patterns for manual recreation on paper or canvas.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-section">
      <h3>Solar System 3D with OpenGL</h3>
      <p>In this project, I created an interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System. The Sun and planets are displayed as 3D objects, with each planet's movement and characteristics like size, speed, and rotation modeled accurately. The planets revolve around the Sun and spin on their own axes, creating a dynamic and realistic simulation. The user can explore the Solar System by moving the camera around using keyboard controls, and the experience is enhanced with jet-like sound effects.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-section">
      <h3>MQTT-Based Remote Alert System</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed a remote notification system using two Raspberry Pi devices and the MQTT protocol. One Raspberry Pi acts as a sensor monitor, while the other controls a physical switch. Whenever the state of the switch changes, an MQTT message is sent to the second Pi, triggering a response. The notification Pi manages an LED board, with a red LED indicating an alert (switch pressed) and a blue LED showing normal operation (switch not pressed). This system provides an efficient wireless monitoring solution.</p>

          <h3> 
            Zero Emission Gas Well</h3><p> Spring 2021-Fall 2021</p>
          <p>The project was sponsored by Nadal & Gussman, a natural gas company located in Ruston, LA. The company desired a solution to reduce natural gas emissions at well sites. During operation of the pneumatic devices, natural gas is emitted to the environment. The major constituent of natural gas is methane, which is a greenhouse gas hazardous than carbon dioxide. The engineering team successfully fabricated a solution which included a storage thank that supplied compressed air to operate the devices, instead of the natural gas previously used. This design completely eliminates the emissions from pneumatic device operation. A remote area power supply (RAPS) system was implemented into the design, as the locations of the gas well-sites do not have access to the power grid.</p>

        <p class="sub-section"><strong>ENGR 120 Series </strong>at Louisiana Tech University, freshmen in engineering learn to use Arduino microcontrollers for sensing and control projects over nine months. They work with LEDs, piezospeakers, servos, photoresistors, switches, conductivity sensors, temperature sensors, transistors, relays, heaters, solenoid valves, RF remote control, and IR object detection. I completed following projects for the series. </p> 
        <p>Later on, I transitioned to become a freshman engineering lab attendant, homework grader and then a teaching assistant for ENGR 120 series while I was working on my undergraduate degree. </p>
